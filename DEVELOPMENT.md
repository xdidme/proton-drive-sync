# Development

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damianb-bitflipper/proton-drive-sync
cd proton-drive-sync
make install
```

## Running Locally

The canonical way to develop is via the `make dev` command, which runs the app directly with bun in watch mode (auto-reload on file changes):

```bash
make dev
```

This runs `start --no-daemon` automatically. Use `Ctrl+C` to stop.

For one-off commands (like service install), use `make run`:

```bash
make run ARGS="service install"
```

| `make build`      | Build standalone binary to `./dist`               |
| `make dev`        | Run `start --no-daemon` with bun (auto-reload)    |
| `make run ARGS=…` | Run one-off commands with bun (exits on complete) |
| `make pre-commit` | Run lint and format on all files                  |
| `make clean`      | Remove build artifacts                            |

## Publishing

To publish a new version:

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Create and push a git tag:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The GitHub Actions release workflow will automatically build binaries for macOS (arm64 and x64) and create a GitHub release.
