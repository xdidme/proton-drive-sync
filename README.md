### Installing Pre-release Versions

<details>
<summary>Pre-release packages</summary>

Pre-release packages (`proton-drive-sync-prerelease`) allow you to test upcoming features before stable release. They conflict with the stable package, so only one can be installed at a time.

#### macOS

```bash
brew tap DamianB-BitFlipper/tap
brew install proton-drive-sync-prerelease
```

#### Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
# Add repository (if not already added)
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://repo.damianb.dev/apt/ * *" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/proton-drive-sync.list
sudo apt update

# Install prerelease
sudo apt install proton-drive-sync-prerelease
```

#### Fedora / RHEL / CentOS

```bash
# Add repository (if not already added)
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/proton-drive-sync.repo << 'EOF'
[proton-drive-sync]
name=Proton Drive Sync
baseurl=https://repo.damianb.dev/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF

# Install prerelease
sudo dnf install proton-drive-sync-prerelease
```

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

On Arch Linux and derivatives, install from the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/proton-drive-sync-prerelease-bin):

```bash
# Install via yay
yay -S proton-drive-sync-prerelease-bin

# Install via paru
paru -S proton-drive-sync-prerelease-bin
```

#### Manual Installation

Download the pre-release tarball for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DamianB-BitFlipper/proton-drive-sync/releases) and extract it:

```bash
# Example for macOS arm64
tar -xzf proton-drive-sync-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
sudo mv proton-drive-sync /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Switching Between Stable and Pre-release

The packages conflict with each other, so installing one will automatically remove the other:

```bash
# Switch to prerelease
sudo apt install proton-drive-sync-prerelease

# Switch back to stable
sudo apt install proton-drive-sync
```

## Usage

### Dashboard

The dashboard runs locally at http://localhost:4242. Use it to configure and manage the sync client.

### Commands

| Command                    | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `proton-drive-sync setup`  | Interactive setup wizard (recommended for first run) |
| `proton-drive-sync auth`   | Authenticate with Proton                             |
| `proton-drive-sync start`  | Start the sync daemon                                |
| `proton-drive-sync stop`   | Stop the sync daemon                                 |
| `proton-drive-sync status` | Show sync status                                     |
| `proton-drive-sync --help` | Show all available commands                          |

### Uninstall

To completely remove proton-drive-sync and all its data:

```bash
proton-drive-sync reset --purge
```

This will stop the service, remove credentials, and delete all configuration and sync history.

For package managers:

- **Homebrew**: `brew uninstall proton-drive-sync`
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt remove proton-drive-sync`
- **Fedora/RHEL**: `sudo dnf remove proton-drive-sync`
